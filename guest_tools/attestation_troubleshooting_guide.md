# Introduction

The attestation verifier tool and SDK are used to verify the
authenticity, integrity, validity, and correctness of attestation
reports generated by GPU operating in Confidential Computing mode. This
document describes the possible error scenarios that may occur when
using the attestation verifier tool and shows the claims and output
messages that can help you recognize such errors. The document also
provides some suggestions on how to handle or avoid these errors.

# Common Error Scenarios

This section outlines the main classes of errors that might happen when
verifying attestation for Confidential Computing workload. Please see
the following sections for a complete list of all possible errors.

-   **Invalid or corrupted attestation report**: These errors occur when
    the attestation report is not well-formed, in unsupported format,
    has missed or incorrect fields, or has been tampered with. The
    verifier tool and SDK will reject such reports and return an error
    code indicating the reason for the failure. To avoid this error, the
    user should ensure that the attestation report is generated by a
    properly configured Nvidia GPU and/or transmitted securely to remote
    services.

-   **Failed RIM Lookup:** These errors happen when RIM lookup cannot
    find a match for a driver version or VBIOS version. This might be
    because Confidential Computing does not support the versions of
    driver and VBIOS being used. Users should check the NVIDIA H100 GPU
    Confidential Computing guide to see the supported versions. If the
    problem still occurs, user should not use the versions that fail and
    report the issue to NVIDIA and the machine owner.

-   **Invalid or corrupted reference integrity measurements (RIM):**
    These errors occur when driver RIM or VBIOS RIM is not available,
    not well-formed, in unsupported format, has missed or incorrect
    fields, or has been tampered with. To avoid this error, the user
    should ensure correct VBIOS, and driver versions are installed in
    the GPU and should ensure RIM is not corrupted/tampered during
    transit.

-   **Expired or invalid certificate**: These errors occur when either
    the certificates in the certificate chain of RIM or device are
    expired or not valid for attestation purposes. Attestation SDK and
    the local verifier tool use X.509 standards to validate the
    certificates and check their validity period and extensions. If a
    RIM for VBIOS or driver has an expired or invalid certificate, user
    should update to a newer version with valid certificates and if a
    device has an expired or invalid certificate, user should find a
    replacement.

-   **Attestation verification error**: This error happens when one or
    more measurements in an attestation report do not match with the
    reference values from driver and VBIOS RIMs. This could be because
    of incorrect settings of the device, altered device, altered
    software, or harmful activity in the device. On encountering this
    error, user must reset their device, reload the driver, and run the
    attestation verification again. If the problem still remains, user
    is advised to stop using the device/software and report to the
    machine owner.

-   **Runtime API errors:** These are errors that happen on the local
    machine when getting attestation reports, certificate chains, or
    basic GPU & Software information. This could be because of a
    software flaw or because of runtime disruptions. User should reboot
    the VM instance and try again. If the problem still remains, user
    should report the error to NVIDIA.

-   **Network or communication error:** This error occurs when the
    verifier tool and SDK encounter a network or communication problem
    when receiving or sending the attestation report or related data.
    The verifier tool and SDK will try to retry or recover from the
    network or communication error. However, if the error persists, the
    verifier tool and SDK will abort the verification process and return
    an error code indicating the reason for the failure. To avoid this
    error, the user should ensure that the network and communication
    channels are reliable and stable.
