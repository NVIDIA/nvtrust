The code in this directory is a subset of libvixl:
 https://github.com/armvixl/vixl
(specifically, it is the set of files needed for disassembly only,
taken from libvixl 1.12).
Bugfixes should preferably be sent upstream initially.

The disassembler does not currently support the entire A64 instruction
set. Notably:
 * Limited support for system instructions.
 * A few miscellaneous integer and floating point instructions are missing.
